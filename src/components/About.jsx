              In modern times, our lives have become more convenient, and
              people's lifestyles are rapidly changing with technology. However,
              beneath the bright lights powered by our resources, many potential
              toxic side effects accompany this progress. Thatâ€™s why we must all
              care about sustainability. It is a way to find balance for the
              world, achievable only if everyone gets involved.
